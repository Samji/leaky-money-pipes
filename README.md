A way to visualize your income and outcome easily and manageably
------------------------------------------------------------------
I would love to be able to see my monthly income and outcome as a series of water tanks / pipes / taps and buckets
Day by day you can add or take away money from any designated taps
At some point during the month your payday bucket tops up the main water tank
Using valves set to an amount designated by you; the income is siphoned off into seperate water tanks
At the designated time the money is drained away from those tanks ready for use next month
